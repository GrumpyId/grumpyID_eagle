Baseline xAPI files for Storyline Developments. Nothing complex in these files....just the basics.  Complex stuff comes later.

I want to give a huge shout out to Devlin Peck and his excellent tutorials that can be found at:

[The Full Guide to xAPI and Storyline](https://www.devlinpeck.com/tutorials/full-guide-xapi-storyline)

If you are not sure what xAPI is or how to take advantage I would recommend that you start with the link above.
